      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Accounting at the University of Illinois Chicago. My research is broadly motivated by the problem of economic agents reneging on promises—whether in financial contracts, supply-chain relationships, or firms’ commitments to payouts. I study how accounting information helps mitigate these frictions by enhancing credibility, facilitating contract design, and sustaining cooperation among parties with conflicting incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Job Market Paper ("Operational Risk and Financial Covenants") is the cornerstone of this agenda, examining how borrowers' operational risks—both demand-side (customer concentration and demand volatility) and supply-side (supplier dependence and fragility)—shape debt contract design and capital allocation. My broader research interests include financial contracting, supply-chain and operational risk, and AI-based textual analysis of corporate disclosures.

      <h2>Research</h2>
<p>
  I study how accounting information alleviates contracting and information frictions that arise when economic agents may renege on promises—across financial contracting, supply-chain relationships, and corporate payout decisions. My work focuses on how disclosure and performance signals foster cooperation, credibility, and efficient capital allocation.
</p>
<p>
  This agenda spans financial contracting, supply-chain, and operational risk, and AI-based textual analysis of 
  corporate disclosures to extract new economic insights from large-scale data.

      <h3>Working Papers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Operational Risk and Financial Covenants</strong> — <em>Job Market Paper / Dissertation (2025)</em><br>
          Examines how borrowers’ demand-side (customer concentration and demand volatility) and supply-side (supplier dependence and fragility) operational risks shape the design of debt covenants. Shows that demand-side risks are associated with performance covenants, while supply-side risks are associated with capital covenants, and that the association between supply-side risks and capital covenants strengthens under the Volcker Rule.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beyond Earnings: The Role of Operating Performance in Shaping Payout Policy</strong> — with Ellen Engel, Stephanie Sikes, and Rustam Zufarov<br>
          Investigates how firms' revenue versus expense triggered operational difficulties shape payout policy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Soft Information and Loan Contract Design: The Role of Managerial Ability</strong> — with Peter Demerjian and Hyunjin Kim<br>
          Studies how lenders incorporate managerial ability as soft information into loan contract terms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Disclosure of Supply Chain Relationships</strong> — solo-authored<br>
          Examines determinants and consequences of voluntary supplier disclosure, focusing on litigation risk and economic outcomes.
        </li>

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        I strive to make accounting intuitive, interactive, and connected to real decisions. 
        My teaching emphasizes the logic behind accounting systems—helping students see how financial reporting 
        supports communication, discipline, and trust in business relationships. 
        I also integrate data analytics and AI-driven tools to prepare students for the evolving business environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Instructor</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction to Financial Accounting (ACTG 210)</strong> — Fall 2023<br>
          Instructor Rating: 4.68 / 5.00 · Course Rating: 4.74 / 5.00 (Response Ratio: 38 / 39)

        Selected student comments (Introduction to Financial Accounting, Fall 2023):
      </p>
      <blockquote style="margin-top:6px; border-left:4px solid var(--border); padding-left:12px; color:var(--muted); font-style:italic;">
        <p>"Almost each lesson was beneficial for my well being"</p>
        <p>“Instructor is very professional, encourage students to ask questions, and always available to help understand challenging topic.”</p>
        <p>“Professor Lee's lectures facilitated discussion by encouraging students to ask questions, which was most beneficial to me. Unlike other
          courses, I had the opportunity to practice problems in class, which made the class more engaging and improved my confidence in the
          subject. By doing practice problems in class instead of passively watching a professor do problems like in other classes, I felt prepared
          when it came time to do my homework. Furthermore, I appreciated Professor Lee's decision to devote adequate class time to reviewing
          past exams. Instead of handing the graded exams to us and asking for it back one minute later, he made an effort to clear up any
          conceptual errors we may've had before asking us to return the exams.”</p>
        <p>“This class helps me to throughly learnt the details about the three major of financial statements which include income stamens, balance
          sheet and state of cash flows. The accounting knowledge I gained in this class has laid a solid foundation for my future professional
          courses. The professor is really responsible for student and able to capture my attention more effectively in class.”</p>
        <p>“Professor Lee has stood out in a way that will be a lasting impression on me for years to come. I struggled at various points with pace and
          professor Lee emailed me directly and stopped me after class to speak with me. He was encouraging and shared in inspiring ways.”</p>

        Responsibilities included leading weekly review sessions, holding office hours, grading, and coordinating 
        exam administration across large undergraduate classes. I also supported course design and created quiz questions.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Teaching Methodology and Innovation</h3>
      <p>I continuously experiment with ways to make accounting intuitive, relevant, and memorable.</p>
      <p>
        In my previous course, I designed an optional <strong><em>Financial Statement Replication Project</em></strong> 
        that allowed students to reconstruct a real firm’s financial statements from raw disclosures 
        and assess how accounting choices influence reported outcomes. This exercise encouraged 
        independent thinking and helped students see how accounting information translates into 
        economic insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I plan to develop a <strong><em>Punk Rock Accounting project</em></strong>—a creative framework 
        for reimagining the tone of the classroom. Accounting, much like punk rock, is exciting, 
        passionate, and sometimes misunderstood as noisy or old-fashioned. Yet its enduring value 
        lies in authenticity, transparency, and hope for a better future. By opening class 
        sessions with punk rock music, I aim to set an atmosphere that captures this spirit: 
        structured but energetic, technical yet expressive, and grounded in a belief that 
        accounting—like punk—can still inspire change.
