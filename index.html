  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Accounting at the University of Illinois Chicago. My research is broadly motivated by the problem of economic agents reneging on promises—whether in financial contracts, supply-chain relationships, or firms’ commitments to payouts. I study how accounting information helps mitigate these frictions by enhancing credibility, facilitating contract design, and sustaining cooperation among parties with conflicting incentives.
  </p>
      
  <p>
    My Job Market Paper ("Operational Risk and Financial Covenants") is the cornerstone of this agenda, examining how borrowers' operational risks—both demand-side (customer concentration and demand volatility) and supply-side (supplier dependence and fragility)—shape debt contract design and capital allocation. My broader research interests include financial contracting, supply-chain and operational risk, textual analysis of Item 1A risk factor disclosures, and applications of artificial intelligence in accounting.

  <h2>Working Papers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operational Risk and Financial Covenants</strong> — <em>Job Market Paper / Dissertation (2025)</em><br>
      Examines how borrowers’ demand-side (customer concentration and demand volatility) and supply-side (supplier dependence and fragility) operational risks shape the design of debt covenants. Shows that demand-side risks are associated with performance covenants, while supply-side risks are associated with capital covenants, and that the association between supply-side risks and capital covenants strengthens under the Volcker Rule.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Beyond Earnings: The Role of Operating Performance in Shaping Payout Policy</strong> — with Ellen Engel, Stephanie Sikes, and Rustam Zufarov<br>
      Investigates how firms' revenue versus expense triggered operational difficulties shape payout policy.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Soft Information and Loan Contract Design: The Role of Managerial Ability</strong> — with Peter Demerjian and Hyunjin Kim<br>
      Studies how lenders incorporate managerial ability as soft information into loan contract terms.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Disclosure of Supply Chain Relationships</strong> — solo-authored<br>
      Examines determinants and consequences of voluntary supplier disclosure, focusing on litigation risk and economic outcomes.

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <p>
    I strive to make accounting intuitive, interactive, and connected to real decisions. 
    My teaching emphasizes the logic behind accounting systems—helping students see how financial reporting 
    supports communication, discipline, and trust in business relationships. 
    I also integrate data analytics and AI-driven tools to prepare students for the evolving business environment.

  <p style="color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px;">
    Responsibilities included leading weekly review sessions, holding office hours, grading, and coordinating 
    exam administration across large undergraduate classes. I also supported course design and created quiz questions.
  </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Teaching Methodology and Innovation</h3>
<p>
  I continuously experiment with ways to make accounting intuitive, relevant, and memorable. 
</p>
      
      <p>
  In my previous course, I designed an optional <em>Financial Statement Replication Project</em> 
  that allowed students to reconstruct a real firm’s financial statements from raw disclosures 
  and assess how accounting choices influence reported outcomes. This exercise encouraged 
  independent thinking and helped students see how accounting information translates into 
  economic insight.
</p>

<p>
  Looking ahead, I plan to develop a <em>“Punk Rock Accounting”</em> project—a creative framework 
  for reimagining the tone of the classroom. Accounting, much like punk rock, is exciting, 
  passionate, and sometimes misunderstood as noisy or old-fashioned. Yet its enduring value 
  lies in authenticity, transparency, and hope for a better financial future. By opening class 
  sessions with punk rock music, I aim to set an atmosphere that captures this spirit: 
  structured but energetic, technical yet expressive, and grounded in a belief that 
  accounting—like punk—can still inspire change.
